The Result of XGBoost is as follows:

-----------------------------------
Model accuracy (%) = 93.88%
Model Standard Deviation (%) =6.39%
Mean Squared Error = 0.244
------------------------------------


The Result of LSTM is as follows:
--------------------------------
Training Loss : 0.39
Training Accuracy (%)  : 60 %
MSE : 0.54

NOTE: The lower accuracy of LSTM is due to lack of enough quantity of training data
--------------------------------
